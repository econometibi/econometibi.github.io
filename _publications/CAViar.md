**Abstract:** Dynamic quantiles, or Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk (CAViaR) models, have been extensively studied at the individual level. However, efforts to estimate multiple dynamic quantiles collectively have been limited. Existing approaches either sequentially estimate fitted quantiles or impose restrictive assumptions on the data generating process. This paper fills this gap by proposing an objective function for the joint estimation of all quantiles, introducing a crossing penalty to guide the process. Monte Carlo experiments validate the effectiveness of the method, offering a flexible and robust approach to modelling multiple dynamic quantiles in time series data.
