======
I am a Senior Economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. I completed my ESRC funded Ph.D. at Heriot-Watt University, where my supervisors were Arnab Bhattacharjee and Mark Schaffer. My economic research interests are macro-financial linkages and spatial econometrics. 

I am particularly interested in understanding the small sample properties of quantile regression especially in macroeconometric settings. Beyond spatial econometrics and quantile regression, I have also explored applying machine learning and bayesian methods to create interpretable models about macro-financial linkages. 

My work has been published in peer reviewed journals such as _Economics Letters_, _Spatial Economic Analysis_, and the _Journal of the Royal Statistical Society_.
