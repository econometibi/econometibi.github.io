======

I am a Senior Economist at the [National Institute of Economic and Social Research](https://www.niesr.ac.uk/) (NIESR), where my work centers on analyzing inequality and regional modelling. My research with NIESR has addressed a range of applied economic issues such as analysing the impact of removing the COVID-19 uplift in universal credit, and measuring the degree of regional inequality. Beyond inequality, I am interested in better understanding macro-financial linkages and the asymetric interaction between the real and financial sectors. Through my research, I aim to make meaningful contributions to policy and practical applications of economic theory, particularly in understanding and mitigating financial and economic risks. 

My doctoral work, completed at Heriot-Watt University with ESRC funding, focused on quantile regression in small sample settings (with applications to macroeconomic risks), under the guidance of Professors Arnab Bhattacharjee and Mark Schaffer. Beyond my primary research on quantile regression's small-sample properties, I have a growing interest in employing machine learning and Bayesian methods to create interpretable models in macroeconomic and financial contexts. 

Iâ€™ve contributed to the academic community through publications in journals such as _Economics Letters_, _Spatial Economic Analysis_, and the _Journal of the Royal Statistical Society_. My projects have included statistical modeling of the cost-of-living crisis, measuring systemic stress in the financial sector, and regional economic forecasting. I also engage with the broader economic research community by presenting my work at conferences such as _MMF_, _EEA_, and _ISF_, and acting as a referee for journals such as _Journal of Forecasting_ and _Spatial Economic Analysis_.

My academic journey spans multiple institutions and specialties. I hold an M.Sc. in Economics with a focus on econometrics from the University of Edinburgh and an M.Sc. in Social Economics from Maastricht University, both completed with distinction. I bring experience in diverse analytical environments, from the Central Bank of Hungary (where I was an Economist) to projects with BP and the Energy Institute.
